Some examples of Javis.jl
note that you will have to checkout the moresvg\_partialdraw branch from my fork of
Javis for these scripts to work.

dvdanim.jl imports dvdlogo.svg and animates it moving around (touching all corners 
in an oddly satisfying way :) ).

hilbert.jl draws a hilbert curve incrementally , the code for the curve is as such taken from
Luxors example for turtle graphics.
